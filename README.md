# bed-booked-full
the front-end and the back-end of my first spring boot and angular application, I combined the two parts here to easily run the app using docker


## this is a sh!tty app
to run: 

open bed-booked-back in your terminal and run docker compose up

as I said, the app is barely working, to use some functionalities you want to register a new account. to do this, first persist a couple of roles to the database (using post man) and then you can register a new account from the front-end
